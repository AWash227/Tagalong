# Tag-Along

## INSTALL

### 1 - Add a keys.js file into tag-along-rev/config/keys.js

Put this code into <b>keys.js</b>:

```js
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: "mongodb://YOUR MONGOURI GOES HERE",
  secretOrKey: "secret"
};
```

## THE IDEA

### Problem

1. College Students want/need to go places. But only half of them have a car.
2. College Students may want to do something but don't know where to go.

### Solution

1. They use Tag-Along to find friends already going in their direction, then "Tag-Along".
2. They scroll through their Tag-Along feed to see what everyone is up to, then join a trip.

## MONETIZATION

1. Serve relevant ads to users (location) from local venues.

- Get venues to pay for the "college-student" demographic.
- Price is based on impressions, clicks, and Trip signups

2. Adventurer Upgrade.

- Get access to exclusive deals in your area.
  - Advertisers know that these are paying individuals which means they are even more likely to spend money.
- Color themes
- Can send up 1 push notifications a week to friends.
